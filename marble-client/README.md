# marble-client
This is a the sample client app for Hyperledger Fabric.  Implemented using the [TIBCO FlogoÂ® Enterprise](https://docs.tibco.com/products/tibco-flogo-enterprise-2-4-0), this app interacts with the Hyperledger Fabric chaincode [`marble-app`](https://github.com/yxuco/flogo-enterprise-app/tree/master/marble-app) and exposes the blockchain records on the marble network as a set of REST APIs.

## Build and start the marble-app fabric network
Complete the prerequisites described in [`marble-app`](https://github.com/yxuco/flogo-enterprise-app/tree/master/marble-app)

Build and deploy the marble-app chaincode (assuming that the `fabric-samples` are installed under your `$GOPATH`):
```
cd $GOPATH/src/github.com/yxuco/flogo-enterprise-app/marble-app
make create
make build
make deploy
```

Start Hyperledger Fabric first-network with CouchDB:
```
cd $GOPATH//src/github.com/hyperledger/fabric-samples/first-network
./byfn.sh up -s couchdb
```

Using the `cli` container, install the `marble-app` chaincode on both `org1` and `org2`, and then instantiate it.
```
docker exec -it cli bash
. scripts/utils.sh
peer chaincode install -n marble_cc -v 1.0 -p github.com/chaincode/marble_cc
setGlobals 0 2
peer chaincode install -n marble_cc -v 1.0 -p github.com/chaincode/marble_cc
ORDERER_ARGS="-o orderer.example.com:7050 --tls --cafile /opt/gopath/src/github.com/hyperledger/fabric/peer/crypto/ordererOrganizations/example.com/orderers/orderer.example.com/msp/tlscacerts/tlsca.example.com-cert.pem"
peer chaincode instantiate $ORDERER_ARGS -C mychannel -n marble_cc -v 1.0 -c '{"Args":["init"]}' -P "AND ('Org1MSP.peer','Org2MSP.peer')"
```

## Build and start the marble-client app
Create, build and start the marble-client app from the model file [`marble_client_app.json`](https://github.com/yxuco/flogo-enterprise-app/blob/master/marble-client/marble_client_app.json):
```
cd $GOPATH/src/github.com/yxuco/flogo-enterprise-app/marble-client
make create
make build
make run
```

The step for `create` may take a few minutes because it analyzes and fetches Go dependencies using `dep`, which is slow.  This issue will be resolved in a future Flogo release when `dep` is replaced by `Go modules`.  Sometimes, `dep` may fail on the first try, in which case, you may manually execute the `dep` one more time, i.e.,
```
cd marble_client/src/marble_client
dep ensure -v -update
cd ../..
```

## Test marble-client app
This app implements a set of REST APIs:
- **Create Marble** (PUT): create a new marble.
- **Transfer Marble** (PUT): transfer a marble to a new owner.
- **Transfer By Color** (PUT): transfer marbles of a specified color to a new owner.
- **Delete Marble** (DELETE): delete the state of a specified marble.
- **Get Marble** (GET): retrieve a marble record by its key.
- **Query By Owner** (GET): query marble records by an owner name.
- **Query By Range** (GET): retrieve marble records in a specified range of keys.
- **Marble History** (GET): retrieve the history of a marble.
- **Query Range Page** (GET): retrieve marble records in a range of keys, with pagination support.

You may use the following commands to test the behavior of these REST APIs.  If you do not like command-line `curl`, you may download and use a REST client tool to submit these REST requests.  For Mac user, the [`Advanced Rest client`](https://install.advancedrestclient.com/install) is pretty user-friendly.

```
# insert test data

curl -H 'Content-Type: application/json' -X PUT -d '{"name":"marble2","color":"red","size":50,"owner":"tom"}' http://localhost:8989/marble/create

curl -H 'Content-Type: application/json' -X PUT -d '{"color":"blue","newOwner":"jerry"}' http://localhost:8989/marble/transfercolor
curl -X GET http://localhost:8989/marble/owner/jerry
curl -X GET http://localhost:8989/marble/range?startKey=marble1&endKey=marble5

# delete marble state, not history
curl -X DELETE http://localhost:8989/marble/delete/marble1
curl -X GET http://localhost:8989/marble/history/marble1

# query pagination using page-size and starting bookmark
curl -X GET http://localhost:8989/marble/rangepage?startKey=marble1&endKey=marble7&pageSize=3
curl -X GET http://localhost:8989/marble/rangepage?startKey=marble1&endKey=marble7&pageSize=3&bookmark=marble5
```

## Cleanup eht marble-app fabric network
Exit the `cli` shell, and then stop and cleanup the Fabric `first-network`.
```
exit
./byfn.sh down
docker rm $(docker ps -a | grep dev-peer | awk '{print $1}')
docker rmi $(docker images | grep dev-peer | awk '{print $3}')
```
