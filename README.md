# flogo-enterprise-app
This package is a [TIBCO Flogo速 Enterprise](https://docs.tibco.com/products/tibco-flogo-enterprise-2-4-0) extension for developing blockchain smart contracts on [Hyperledger Fabric](https://www.hyperledger.org/projects/fabric).

It provides Flogo速 triggers, activities and connectors to enable Flogo速 as a visual programming environment for blockchain apps on Hyperledger Fabric.

The sample [`fabric-contract`](https://github.com/yxuco/flogo-enterprise-app/tree/master/fabric-contract) illustrates how this extension can simplify the blockchain app development by using the visual programming environment of the TIBCO Flogo速 Enterprise.
