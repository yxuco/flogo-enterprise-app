# flogo-enterprise-app
This package is a [TIBCO Flogo速 Enterprise](https://docs.tibco.com/products/tibco-flogo-enterprise-2-4-0) extension for developing blockchain smart contracts on [Hyperledger Fabric](https://www.hyperledger.org/projects/fabric).

It provides Flogo速 triggers, activities and connectors to enable Flogo速 as a visual programming environment for blockchain apps on Hyperledger Fabric.

The samples [`marble-app`](https://github.com/yxuco/flogo-enterprise-app/tree/master/marble-app) and [`marble-private`](https://github.com/yxuco/flogo-enterprise-app/tree/master/marble-private) are models implementing the same application logic of the corresponding `fabric samples`(https://github.com/hyperledger/fabric-samples/tree/release-1.4/chaincode).  They illustrate how this Flogo extension can simplify the blockchain app development by using the visual programming in the TIBCO Flogo速 Enterprise.
